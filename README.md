# Work-Day-Scheduler
Will display business hours from 9am-5pm. 
The top date is updated consistently via moment().

Time block will be either: 

  Greyed out if the hour has past 

  Red if it is the current hour  

  Green if it a future hour 

Any info typed into the textboxes and then saved will be stored in local storage and will still be displayed even if the page is refreshed. Below is a screen shot of the working application. ![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86748117/135363802-91d89662-4f67-4ded-9d71-cba12b7cec65.PNG)
